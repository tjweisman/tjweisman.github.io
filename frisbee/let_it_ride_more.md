# Let it ride: sample strategy tables

The tables below show equilibrium strategies for many different versions of *Let it ride.* For more details on how this works, check out my [writeup on the topic](frisbee/let_it_ride).

#### How to read this table

The number in each box of the table represents *how many points you should be willing to risk* in any given situation. In other words, if the box at (0, 0) reads "1", then when the score is tied at zero, you should let it ride *one time* before banking your points.

All of these tables are computed under the assumption that each team has a fixed probability of scoring on their endzone possessions (and that this probability is the same for each team). Each team is also assumed to play *rationally*. See the [full article](frisbee/let_it_ride) for examples of strategy tables where these assumptions are loosened.
